# ðŸ§  AI Mental Health Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered mental health chatbot designed to provide insights into mental health indicators such as anxiety, depression, stress, and general wellbeing. It uses a combination of voice, facial expression, and text-based inputs to analyze and provide feedback to users.

## Features

- **Voice Emotion Analysis**: Extracts audio features and predicts emotions using a trained LSTM model.
- **Facial Expression Analysis**: Analyzes facial expressions to infer emotional states using DeepFace.
- **Text Sentiment Analysis**: Uses TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of user inputs.
- **User Profile Insights**: Provides mental health insights based on user-provided data such as sleep schedule, occupation, and age.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Allows users to interact with the chatbot via text, voice, or a combination of both.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays mental health indicators such as anxiety, depression, stress, and general wellbeing.
